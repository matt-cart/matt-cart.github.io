I recently completed my PhD in Microbiology & Immunology at Stanford University in [Justin Sonnenburg's lab](https://sonnenburglab.stanford.edu/). I was supported by a Stanford Graduate Fellowship in Science & Engineering (the Smith Fellowship). I studied the impact that diet and lifestyle on the human gut microbiome using metagenomics and metabolomics. 

Previously, I worked at [Caribou Biosciences](https://www.cariboubio.com/) where we studied the basic biology of both on-target and off-target editing in human cells using Cas9. I have an undergraduate degree in Biological Engineering from Cornell University, where I worked in [Julius Lucks's lab](https://luckslab.org/) studying the structure-function relationship of non-coding RNAs.
