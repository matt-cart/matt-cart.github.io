I recently completed my PhD in Microbiology & Immunology at Stanford University in [Justin Sonnenburg's lab](https://sonnenburglab.stanford.edu/), where I was supported by a Smith Fellowship. I studied the impact that diet and lifestyle have on the human gut microbiome using metagenomics in a study of the Hadza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania. I also studied the effect of vegan and omnivorous diets on the gut microbiome and how these diets impact host metabolic health. The latter study was featured in the Netflix documentary [You Are What You Eat: A Twin Experiment](https://www.netflix.com/title/81133260). 

Previously, I worked at [Caribou Biosciences](https://www.cariboubio.com/) where we studied the basic biology of both on-target and off-target Cas9 editing in human cells. I have an undergraduate degree in Biological Engineering from Cornell University, where I worked in [Julius Lucks's lab](https://luckslab.org/) studying the structure-function relationship of non-coding RNAs.
