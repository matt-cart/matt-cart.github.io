I recently completed my PhD in Microbiology & Immunology at Stanford University in [Justin Sonnenburg's lab](https://sonnenburglab.stanford.edu/), where I was supported by a [Smith Fellowship](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/sgf). I am broadly interested in the interface between human physiology and gut microbial metabolism. To study questions in this space, I have worked extensively with various human cohorts where I deploy a variety of computational and experimental techniques ranging from metagenomics to metabolomics to gnotobiotic mouse experiments to understand host-microbe interactions. 

In the Sonnenburg Lab, I studied the impact that diet and lifestyle have on the human gut microbiome using metagenomics in [a study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37348505/) of the Hadza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania. We also performed multiple human dietary interventions studies in collaboration with [Christopher Gardner's group](https://med.stanford.edu/nutrition.html) to understand how specific diets and dietary supplements affect the gut microbiome and host metabolic health. Our most recent study was featured in the 2024 Netflix documentary [You Are What You Eat: A Twin Experiment](https://www.netflix.com/title/81133260). 

Previously, I was employee #3 at [Caribou Biosciences](https://www.cariboubio.com/), founded by Nobel laureate Jennifer Doudna, where we made early contributions to understanding Cas9-based genome editing in human cells. I have an undergraduate degree in Biological Engineering from Cornell University, where I worked in [Julius Lucks's lab](https://luckslab.org/) studying the structure-function relationship of non-coding RNAs.
