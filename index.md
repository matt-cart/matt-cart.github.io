I recently completed my PhD in Microbiology & Immunology at Stanford University in [Justin Sonnenburg's lab](https://sonnenburglab.stanford.edu/), where I was supported by a [Smith Fellowship](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/sgf). I studied the impact that diet and lifestyle have on the human gut microbiome using metagenomics in a study of the Hadza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania. I also studied the effect of vegan and omnivorous diets on the gut microbiome and how these diets impact host metabolic health. This latter study was featured in the 2024 Netflix documentary [You Are What You Eat: A Twin Experiment](https://www.netflix.com/title/81133260). 

Previously, I was employee #3 at [Caribou Biosciences](https://www.cariboubio.com/), founded by Nobel laureate Jennifer Doudna, where we made early contributions to understanding Cas9-based genome editing in human cells. I have an undergraduate degree in Biological Engineering from Cornell University, where I worked in [Julius Lucks's lab](https://luckslab.org/) studying the structure-function relationship of non-coding RNAs.
